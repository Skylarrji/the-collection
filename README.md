# The Collection

## Setup

Open the project on VSCode and open two terminals:

### Terminal #1 (Frontend)
Enter the following commands for pure front end work:
`cd my-webapp`
`npm start`

If running it with backend, run the following:
`cd my-webapp`
`npm run build`
Then, copy and paste the build folder that was created to the my-webapp-backend folder.

### Terminal #2 (Backend)
Enter the following commands:
`cd my-webapp-backend`
`npm run dev`
