# The Collection 📖

# Purpose 📝
Want to be able to share your ideas freely with others? Then visit The Collection, a web app inspired by popular sites such as Medium and Reddit where users can not only post articles that represent who they are and what they're interested in, but also upvote and comment on other people's articles as well!

# Features 🖋️

- **Upvoting:** Users can upvote and undo their upvote on articles they like (or later dislike).

- - **Topic Tags:** For each article, relevant topic tags are automatically generated to allow for easier searching and identification of relevant articles.
